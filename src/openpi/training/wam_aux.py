"""WAM-style auxiliary future-prediction loss for pi0.5 (see docs/wam_aux_loss.md).

Training-time only, zero inference cost. Alongside the normal flow-matching action loss, the model
predicts its own FUTURE right-wrist embedding (k frames ahead) from its CURRENT one, so gradient
from a predictive objective reaches the shared vision backbone.

"now" and "future" are both Pi0's own right-wrist prefix embeddings from `embed_prefix`. The
context comes from the ONLINE params (gradient flows into the backbone through it -- that is the
point); the target comes from an EMA copy with a stop-gradient, giving the BYOL/JEPA asymmetry a
self-predictive loss needs to avoid collapsing to a constant.

That EMA copy is `TrainState.aux_ema_params`, which is deliberately SEPARATE from openpi's own
`ema_params`: see the comment on TrainState for why reusing the latter would silently change which
weights every downstream serve and validate loads.

This module supplies only what Pi0 does not already have -- the predictor (a per-position query
seeded from the context, refined by cross-attention blocks conditioned on the offset k and the
action window t..t+k), a GRU action-sequence encoder, and one small EMA-lagged down-projection.
The loss is mean per-token cosine distance on population-centered representations; the history of
why it is cosine rather than flow matching, and why centering is load-bearing, is in
`compute_aux_loss` and in the doc.

    This REPLACED a flow-matching formulation (noise the target, regress a velocity), which was
    ported from the offline Phase 0 probe on the theory that it would avoid regressing to the mean
    on a multimodal future. Measured on a real 500-step run, that objective was uninterpretable:
    it fell to ~1.03 within 30 steps and sat there, because "estimate the target, treat the noise
    as unpredictable" is an attractor pinned at exactly 1 + s for unexplained target variance s.
    A loss of 1.043 was consistent with s ~ 0.44 OR s ~ 0.043 depending on whether the predictor
    used the noised input at all -- a 10x ambiguity in the only quantity that mattered. A control
    on synthetic data with a known-predictable future confirmed the failure mode: informative
    context scored 1.664 against 1.651 for context carrying NO information, i.e. the objective was
    not using the context at all while still looking converged. Latent prediction already solves
    the multimodality problem the flow wrapper was added for -- the encoder is free to drop
    unpredictable content -- and nothing here ever samples from the flow, so its machinery bought
    only a pedestal that hid the signal.

    Cosine is scale-free, so unlike the flow objective it cannot be inflated by a drifting
    representation scale, and it reads on an interpretable range: 0 is perfect, ~1.0 is
    uncorrelated.

    `is_pad` marks samples where LeRobot clamped the future index at an episode boundary, so the
    "future" frame is really the current one. Those are excluded from both returned per-example
    quantities: they are trivially satisfiable, and left in they would ALSO depress copy_baseline,
    corrupting the very instrument that exists to detect triviality.
